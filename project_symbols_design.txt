- Overextension should be punished
- Consumables should have neutral effects (make the game different in a way that is neither inherently good nor bad)

- Player has 3 abilities, and a primary attack
- Abilities can be switched out for others, outside of fights
- Each player has a deck of 16 tarot cards (4 sets of 4)
- Abilities interact differently with different tarot cards. A given ability will have 4 positive colors, 8 neutral colors, and 4 negative colors
- Each ability has a particular color that gives it a special additional effect
- Deck reshuffles when 0 cards left
- Deck-manipulation abilities exist, but are not common. When they do exist, they are alongside tangible effects


- Discard pile is shared
- Support abilities can pull from discard pile
- Each card is Sun/Earth/Moon and a zodiac sign (rock/fire/air/water).
- Sun/Moon supercharges numbers. Earth/fire/air/water sometimes modifies effect. Specific sign adds bonus effect.
- Abilities are on a global cooldown of 15 seconds.
- SPECIAL effects make abilities about as good as a non-special would be in its ideal situation (and better than any non-special in an average situation). It should be slightly hard to decide, sometimes, between using the ability that's best for the situation and using the ability that has a SPECIAL available. As a rule of thumb, a SPECIAL being twice as good as a non-special should make this the case.
- Each slot for each class should have an option for CC, SINGLE-TARGET, or UTILITY (unsure about this though)

Keyword BLESS: a player who is BLESSED with a card will have that card applied to any abilities they use in addition to their drawn card.

Gunslinger Class:
- O: For 4/8/15 seconds, every critical basic attack draws a card and has an additional elemental effect (knock-back/ignite/chain-lightning/freeze) from that card. SPECIAL: You can see your top card, and all basic attacks are critical hits.
- D: Your next basic attack fires a wide-spread close-range shotgun that stuns all enemies hit for 0.1/1/2 seconds, and deals 250%/500%/1000% total damage. SPECIAL: Your basic attacks are this way for 4/8/15 seconds.
- S: ?

Oracle Class:
- Class Ability: You can always see the top card of your deck. You can see each party members discard pile, in addition to your own.
- O: Choose a party member. Completely restore their health. Remove all debuffs. Their next draw will be the best card in their deck (element ignored). SPECIAL: This applies to all party members.
- D: Apply an elemental stun (chosen by card element) to enemies within a 4/6/12 meter radius for 1/3/8 seconds. SPECIAL: Those enemies die if hit critically while stunned.
- S: Choose an enemy. For the next 10/20/30 seconds, you can read its mind (see its deck/discard, see its upcoming attacks, see its exact health, etc). SPECIAL: Whenever you attack that enemy, it discards the top card of its deck.

Fairymother Class:
Like Engineer from RoR, creates a safe area for teammates. Summons fairies to do bidding.
